                        Our Twenty Four Seven Care Services are designed for individuals who require continuous support throughout the day and night to remain safe, comfortable, and well cared for in their own homes. Some people live with conditions, age related changes, or complex needs that require reassurance and assistance at any moment, and this service ensures that they are never left without the help they need. The service is built around a personalised plan that reflects daily routines, health requirements, personal preferences, and the particular challenges a person may face.

                    <p>
                        We begin by carrying out a detailed assessment, working closely with the individual and their family to understand daytime and night time needs. This includes mobility, sleep patterns, medication routines, personal care requirements, and the level of supervision or monitoring needed for safety. Based on this assessment, we organise continuous support through a combination of day carers, night carers, or a dedicated live in carer, depending on what is most suitable for the person’s wellbeing.

                        Our carers provide sensitive assistance with all aspects of personal care, including washing, dressing, toileting, and safe movement around the home. They help with meals, hydration, and medication in line with the care plan. During the day, they encourage engagement in familiar activities, support appointments, and promote social contact. During the night, they remain attentive, providing reassurance, responding to calls, and supporting safe movement, especially for those who wake frequently or experience confusion or pain.

                        This level of support can greatly reduce the risk of falls, accidents, and distress. It is especially beneficial for people living with dementia, advanced physical conditions, or significant frailty. The presence of trained carers also means that changes in health or behaviour are noticed quickly and can be reported to the appropriate health professionals. This helps prevent avoidable hospital admissions and ensures a more consistent and stable experience of care.

                        Families often find that Twenty Four Hour Care brings peace of mind, as they know their loved one is being supported by compassionate and reliable professionals. Our team remains in regular communication with families and works alongside community nurses, therapists, and other professionals to ensure that care remains safe, responsive, and centred on the person.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most importantly, our service provides a sense of security and comfort, helping individuals feel valued and supported at any time of the day or night. By offering continuous care in a familiar environment, we help people maintain independence, dignity, and quality of life while ensuring that they receive the right level of support exactly when they need it.
