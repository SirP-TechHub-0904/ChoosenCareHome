                        Our Dementia Care service is built on understanding, patience, and respect for each individual’s life history and personal identity. We recognise that dementia affects everyone differently, and our aim is to help each person live as comfortably, safely, and meaningfully as possible. Through attentive, person centred care, we support memory, engagement, and confidence while reducing distress and promoting a calm, reassuring environment.

                        The first step in our approach is to understand who the person is behind the diagnosis. By learning about their past experiences, routines, relationships, preferences, and interests, we are able to create a support plan that reflects their unique story. This helps us deliver care that feels familiar and comforting, reducing confusion and supporting emotional wellbeing.

                        Our carers use communication techniques that promote reassurance and clarity. They support individuals with washing, dressing, meals, medication, mobility, and other everyday routines while maintaining dignity at all times. They also provide gentle prompts, emotional support, and consistent presence, which can significantly reduce anxiety and help individuals feel safe.

                        Meaningful activity is important for people living with dementia. We encourage involvement in familiar tasks, music, reminiscence sessions, gentle exercise, or simple social activities that bring joy, improve mood, and support cognitive stimulation. Where possible, we also help individuals stay connected to their community, whether that involves a walk, a visit to a local group, or time in the garden.

                        Families are an essential part of the care journey, and we work closely with them to ensure consistency, understanding, and reassurance. Our team provides updates, guidance, and emotional support to help families navigate the changes dementia brings. We also adapt care as the condition progresses, ensuring that safety and comfort remain central throughout.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, our Dementia Care service offers more than practical assistance. It provides a compassionate, structured approach that respects the individual, helps them remain connected to the world around them, and supports their wellbeing every day. By delivering care at home or in a homely setting, we promote familiarity, comfort, and a stronger sense of identity.
